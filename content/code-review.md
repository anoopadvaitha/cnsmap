Minor changes to a workload, or the infrastructure where the workload has been deployed, may have far-reaching security consequences. To mitigate the risk of unintended consequences, teams are encouraged to use the "four eyes" principle when conducting code review before prior changes are merged into the codebase (e.g. implementing a pull request in git workflow).
